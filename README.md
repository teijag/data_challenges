# data_challenges

1. conversion_rate: How's our website doing? In this project, I used conversion rate as the metric to examine how our website is doing by country, demographics, user types and source. I also built a logistic regression model and random forest to predict the conversion rate of an individual and came up with ideas to improve revenue

2. ab_test: Does the recent change on website localization actually helps the conversion? In this project, I visualized the a/b test data with Tableau, analyzed it using hypothesis testing to verify the impact of the change, and proposed ideas for next steps.

3. employee_retention: why do employee leaves? In this project, I wrote about the challenges in using censored data to predict the employees' survival (retention), and compared the model performance when different ranges of input data were used. In the end, I talked about the proactive strategies for the HRs to take. 

4. customer_complaints: Are the customers happy with us? In this project, I studied the current complaints and grouped them into clusters to find the most efficient ways to handle each of them.
